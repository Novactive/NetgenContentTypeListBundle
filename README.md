Netgen ContentType List Bundle
==============================

Netgen ContentType List Bundle is an eZ Publish 5 bundle that provides a field type to select and store a list of content type identifiers.

This repository represents eZ Publish 5 rewrite of the original eZ Publish 4 extension located at [http://github.com/netgen/ngclasslist](/netgen/ngclasslist). However, eZ Publish 4 extension is still required to populate field type through the admin interface.
